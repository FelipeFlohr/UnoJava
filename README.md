# 2flps' Uno - Java Edition

Uno game made in Java using the Swing for the UI. Inspired by my first Uno project: [Uno game made in Python](https://github.com/FelipeFlohr/unopython).

## Requirements
- [JRE](https://www.java.com/) if you are just going to run the JAR or [JDE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) if you are going to build the project (the project was made using Java 17);
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) if you are going to build the project. Its built-in Swing Frame Designer was used in the "SettingsFrame".

## Rules
Check out [this article made by Ultra Board Games](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/uno/game-rules.php) where they explain how to play Uno. Just be aware that there's no Blank Card and "scoring system" in this version.
